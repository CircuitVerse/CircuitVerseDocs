                                                            Contributing To The Documentation

## Contributing to the docs is a excellent way to get involved, meet the community and to improve  CircuitVerse!

## General Guidelines

Please follow these general guidelines.

    DO commit to master directly. Even for the smallest and most trivial fix.
    ALWAYS open a pull request and ask somebody else to merge your contribution.
    NEVER merge it yourself.

## Edit

Head over to the https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerseDocs 

 You can then click the Fork button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of our site in your GitHub account called a fork.

Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to the index page for your fork and click New Pull Request to let us know about it.

    Fill in the text-box Commit changes at the end of the page telling why you did the changes.
    Press the button Commit changes next to it when you are done.
    Head to the green New pull request button (e.g., by navigating to your fork’s root and clicking Pull requests on the right menu-bar.
    Click Send pull request.

This is the recommended way for smaller changes, and for people who are not familiar with Git.

Your changes are now queued for review under project’s Pull requests tab on GitHub.

For more information about writing documentation please read the styleguide and also our docs about helper tools.

You will receive a message when your request has been integrated into the documentation.

At that moment, feel free to delete the copy of the documentation you created under your account on GitHub.

Next time you contribute, fork again. That way you’ll always have a fresh copy of the documentation to work on.



## Before You Make A Pull Request


    Before you commit your changes, it’s a good idea to run a spell check.
    Make sure that all links you put in are valid.
    Check that you are using valid restructured text.
