## ROM

ROM also known as "Read Only Memory" is a non-volatile memory device that is generally used in computers to store the initial program that runs when the computer is powered on. The ROM in [CircuitVerse](https:circuitverse.org/simulator) accepts 4 bit address input. The corresponding value stored in the particular address is returned as a 8 bit output, *Remember, initial address always starts  from 0.*

The **enable** signal is used to enable the ROM.
