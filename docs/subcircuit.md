# Subcircuits

> Users can create subcircuits from existing circuits and use it as block elements in larger circuits. Users can also modify the position of the inputs and outputs of the subcircuit.

## Subcircuit Menu
Create a circuit (circuit1) with inputs and outputs. Insert another circuit (Circuit &rightarrow; new circuit). Lets call this circuit 2. Then to insert circuit1 as a subcircuit in circuit 2, go to Circuit &rightarrow; insert Subcircuit. That is how you insert a subcircuit.

## Editing layout of a subcircuit
To edit layout of the circuit, click on an empty space to see the property menu of the current circuit. Then click on edit layout.

You should be able to see a window where you can change the width, height of all the subcircuit. Position the title of the subcircuit. To change the position of the node, simple drag on a node and place it where you wish. Please note that a node can only be placed on the perimeter of the subciruit.
