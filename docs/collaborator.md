# Adding Collaborators

> CircuitVerse allows the users to add collaborator(s) to their projects.

Contributing Authors: [@amansingla97](https://github.com/amansingla97/)

Collaboration in the CircuitVerse is when two or more people work together by contributing to the same project.
The user can collaborate with CircuitVerse members by adding their email-ids separated by comma or space. 
Collaborates can access as well as update the project.

** Note: Collaboration is not synced between the changes made by collaborators. Every save overwrites and updates the project.**
