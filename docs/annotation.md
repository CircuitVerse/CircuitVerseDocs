# Annotation Elements

> Circuitverse allows you to annotate your circuit in many ways. <br />
> Annotating the circuit help the reader better understand your circuit. There are three ways we can annotate our circuit: adding labels, creating titles, and adding detail.

## Adding Labels

You can label any circuit element using the property menu. You can also chose the position of the label.
