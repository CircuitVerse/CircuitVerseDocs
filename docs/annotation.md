# Annotation Elements

> Circuitverse allows you to annotate your circuit in many ways. <br />
> Annotating your circuit help the reader better understand the circuit. There are three ways you can annotate your circuit: adding labels, creating titles, and adding detail.

## Adding Labels

You can label any circuit element using the property menu. You can also choose the position of the label.

> Also, you can add details in your circuit, to help further convey the logic, highlight specific points, or explain the flow of circuit, using the Text feature. <br/>
> Circuitverse also provides you with two more features to annotate your circuit namely **Arrow** and **Rectangle**.

## Arrow 

Just navigate through `Misc -> Arrow` and just drag & drop it to the required place. Also, you can change it's direction either by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or using the properties menu.
