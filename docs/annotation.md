# Annotation Elements

> Circuitverse allows you to annotate your circuit in many ways. <br />
> Annotating your circuit help the reader better understand the circuit. There are three ways you can annotate your circuit: adding labels, creating titles, and adding detail.

## Adding Labels

You can label any circuit element using the property menu. You can also chose the position of the label.

## Creating Titles

You can title the circuit using the Text feature present under Misc.

> Also, you can add details in your circuit, to help further convey the logic, highlight specific points, or explain the flow of circuit, using the Text feature. <br/>
> Circuitverse also provides you with two more features to annotate your circuit namely **Arrow** and **Rectangle**.

## Arrow 

Just navigate through `Misc -> Arrow` and just drag & drop it to the required place. Also, you can change it's direction either by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or using the properties menu.

## Rectangle

If you ever feel the need to highlight or mark a specific portion of your circuit, you can use *Rectangle*, by navigating through `Misc -> Rectangle` and just drag & drop it to the required place. You can change its dimensions by using the properties menu.
