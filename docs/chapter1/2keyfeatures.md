1. **Build and simulate your circuits in the cloud**: Create and run your simulations directly in your browser without the need for software installation or operating system-specific instructions. The seamless process of circuit creation and simulation allows users to edit, troubleshoot, and modify their circuit designs even while the simulation is running. Users can save and open their circuits online via their dashboard or offline locally on their machine.

2. **Transform your ideas using a powerful, intuitive and interactive schematic editor**:

   - **Design using an easy-to-use interactive schematic editor**: As users drag and drop circuit elements onto the canvas, horizontal and vertical wires can be drawn to complete the circuit connections. The wires are color-coded, making it easier to test and analyze circuit simulations.
   - **Customize input attributes of circuit components**: CircuitVerse offers a comprehensive library of circuit elements, ranging from basic logic gates to register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and from simple input/output components to system-level modules. Most CircuitVerse components include customizable attributes, enabling users to build complex designs within the simulator.
   - **Design supports multibit wires (buses)**: Every input and output circuit element in CircuitVerse has an associated bit width. Most CircuitVerse components include attributes that allow users to customize the bit widths of their inputs and outputs. The platform supports multibit wires between components that require varying bit widths. When necessary, splitters can be used to route individual bits in different directions.

3. **Insert subcircuit**: Hierarchical circuits can be created by nesting and reusing smaller circuits in larger circuits (something like this). No need to mention verilog here.

4. **Export images in multiple formats**: High-resolution CircuitVerse images can be exported in multiple formats for different views and background options.

5. **Visualize circuit simulations using timing diagram**: Timing diagrams can be used to analyze and debug the behavior of circuits for different input sequences, helping identify logical errors and race conditions. They can also be paired with the Flag circuit element to illustrate concepts such as propagation delay, stable states, and race conditions.

6. **Embed simulations across webpages and presentations**: Since CircuitVerse webpages are built using HTML5, an iframe can be generated to embed each simulation within a webpage. Alternatively, users can download the CircuitVerse Chrome extension to embed live circuits directly into Google Slides presentations.

7. **Connect and collaborate over CircuitVerse**: Users can share their unique circuit URLs and seek assistance through the CircuitVerse online forums. They can also collaborate on their creations or fork existing contributions from other users to facilitate meaningful learning.
