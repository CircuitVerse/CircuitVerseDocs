# System Requirements

To access CircuitVerse simulations on a Mac or PC, users need a broadband internet connection and a compatible web browser. CircuitVerse officially supports Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Although the simulator has been successfully run on Apple Safari, it is not officially supported at this time.

> Note: Since CircuitVerse is built using HTML5, browsers do not require Flash Player or JavaScript to load the simulator.

Additionally, CircuitVerse does not support touch screen devices or mobile browsers on any platform.
