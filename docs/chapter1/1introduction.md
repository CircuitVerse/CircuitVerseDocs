Inspired by Logisim, CircuitVerse is an open-source educational tool for designing and visualizing digital logic circuit simulations in the cloud. Educators, students, electronics engineers, and hobbyists can experiment with digital circuit simulations directly from their browsers to explore a variety of “what-if” scenarios.

Users can share their creations using unique circuit URLs or fork projects from the CircuitVerse community to satisfy their curiosity and promote collaborative learning. Figure 1.1 shows a ripple carry adder simulation built using CircuitVerse.

## Classroom Management and Teaching Tools

Developed for educators by educators, the CircuitVerse platform delivers a high-quality learning experience in a scalable manner. Educators can manage, track, and achieve classroom learning goals using a single, powerful solution.

They can create and manage student groups, post assignments, define submission deadlines, and add or export grades. Using the CircuitVerse Chrome extension, educators can embed live circuits directly into Google Slides to demonstrate concepts without switching between tabs. Alternatively, circuits can be exported as images or embedded into web pages using iframes.

## Community and Collaboration

As the CircuitVerse community continues to grow, educators and students can join online forums to share ideas, ask questions, and exchange resources related to teaching and learning digital logic design.
