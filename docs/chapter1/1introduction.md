Inspired by Logisim, CircuitVerse is an open-source educational platform for designing and visualizing digital logic circuit simulations directly in the cloud. Educators, students, electronics engineers, and hobbyists can experiment with digital circuits from their browsers to explore a wide range of “what-if” scenarios.

Users can share their creations through unique circuit URLs or fork projects from the CircuitVerse community to satisfy their curiosity and encourage collaborative learning.  
Figure 1.1 shows a ripple carry adder simulation built using CircuitVerse.

## Classroom Management and Teaching Tools

Developed for educators by educators, the CircuitVerse platform delivers a high-quality learning experience in a scalable and intuitive way. It enables instructors to manage, track, and achieve classroom learning objectives using a single, powerful solution.

Educators can create and manage student groups, assign coursework, set submission deadlines, and add or export grades (see Figure 1.2). With the CircuitVerse Chrome extension, live circuits can be embedded directly into Google Slides for seamless demonstrations without switching tabs. Circuits can also be exported as images or embedded on web pages using iframes.

## Community and Collaboration

As the CircuitVerse community continues to grow, educators and students can participate in online forums to share ideas, ask questions, and exchange learning resources related to digital logic design.
