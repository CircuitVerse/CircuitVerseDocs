## What is CircuitVerse?

Inspired by Logisim, **CircuitVerse** is an open-source educational platform for designing and visualizing digital logic circuits directly in the browser. It enables educators, students, electronics engineers, and hobbyists to experiment with digital circuit simulations and explore various “what-if” scenarios.

Users can share their creations using unique circuit URLs or fork projects from the CircuitVerse community to satisfy their curiosity.

## Classroom Management

Developed for educators by educators, CircuitVerse delivers a **high-quality learning experience** at scale. Educators can:

- Create and manage student groups
- Assign projects with deadlines
- Track submissions and export grades

Using the CircuitVerse Chrome extension, instructors can embed live circuits into Google Slides or export simulations as images or iFrames.
