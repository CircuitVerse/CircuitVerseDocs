Inspired by Logisim, CircuitVerse is an open-source educational tool for designing and visualizing digital logic circuit simulations in the cloud.

Users—including educators, students, electronics engineers, and hobbyists—can experiment with digital circuit simulations directly from their browsers to explore various "what-if" scenarios. Users can share their creations using unique circuit URLs or fork contributions from the CircuitVerse community to satisfy their curiosity.

Figure 1.1 shows a screenshot of a ripple carry adder simulation built using CircuitVerse.

## Classroom Management for Educators

Developed for educators by educators, the CircuitVerse platform delivers a high-quality learning experience in a scalable way. Educators can manage, track, and achieve their classroom learning goals in a single, powerful solution.

Key features include:

- Create and manage student groups
- Post assignments with submission deadlines
- Add or export grades seamlessly

Refer to Figure 1.2 for an overview of these features.

### Chrome Extension

Using the CircuitVerse Chrome extension, educators can embed live circuits in their Google Slides and demonstrate concepts without navigating across tabs. Alternatively, they can export images or embed iFrames within their webpages.

## Community & Collaboration

As the CircuitVerse community grows, educators and students can join the online forums to share ideas, questions, and resources related to teaching and learning digital logic design.
