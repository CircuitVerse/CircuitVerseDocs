# Building Circuit Simulations within CircuitVerse

In this section, we will build a circuit of a full adder exploring the different stages of building a live circuit within the CircuitVerse simulator. We will start off by creating a circuit of a half adder and insert it as a subcircuit to create a 4-bit full adder.

## Create and Save New Project 

Although the CircuitVerse simulator saves the circuit periodically and any unsaved circuits may be recovered from the browsers memory, the user must create an account and save the CircuitVerse project online for future reference. 

Follow the below steps to create a new project and save the circuit online: 

1. Navigate to [https://circuitverse.org/](https://circuitverse.org/).

2. Click on the **Launch Simulator** button to launch the simulator. Refer Figure 7.1.

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.1</em></div>

3. Navigate to the **Quick Access Panel**. Click on either **Save Online**  icon or **Save Offline** icon to receive the** Enter Project Name**: pop-up window for saving the circuit. Refer Figure 7.2. 

    > NOTE: If a project file is saved online,  it is available on the dashboard. Alternatively, any project file that is saved offline, is downloaded to your browserâ€™s local storage.

## Create Circuit Using CircuitVerse Simulation 

After successfully creating a CircuitVerse user account, follow the below steps for creating a circuit of a half adder within the CircuitVerse simulator:

6. Navigate to the **CIRCUITS ELEMENTS** panel. Identify the relevant circuit elements and drop them on the canvas. If required, you may search for an element in the search bar. Refer Figure 7.5.

    ![drawing](../images/img_chapter7/7.5.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.5</em></div>
  
7. Connect the circuit elements by clicking on one node and dragging the mouse to the other node. Refer to Figure 7.6 for the final circuit connection. 

    > TIP: Hold down Ctrl key. Click on a node and simply move the cursor to the final node to which it needs to be attached. Clicking on the wire will insert a node at that position. Upon reaching the final node, leave the Ctrl key and click on the node to end the wire.

    ![drawing](../images/img_chapter7/7.6.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.6</em></div>

8. Select a circuit element. It will be highlighted in yellow as shown in Figure 7.7.

9. Navigate to the **PROPERTIES** panel. Edit the **Label** parameter to add a label for the selected circuit element. Refer Figure 7.7.

    ![drawing](../images/img_chapter7/7.7.png)
    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.7</em></div>
    
10. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add labels for the remaining circuit elements as shown in Figure 7.7.

## Edit Circuit Layout

Before inserting a circuit as a subcircuit, the circuit layout must be edited to prevent any loss of wiring connections across different nodes or ports in the integrated circuit schematic may be lost. 

Follow the below steps to view and edit the circuit layout of the half-adder circuit:

11. Navigate to the **PROPERTIES** panel.

12. Click on the **Edit Layout** button to display the circuit layout for the built circuit (refer Figure 7.8).

    ![drawing](../images/img_chapter7/7.8.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.8</em></div>

13. The **Edit Layout** screen displays the page as shown in Figure 7.9. The circuit is placed inside a back box. The **LAYOUT** panel displays different options for editing the layout of the circuit. 

    ![drawing](../images/img_chapter7/7.9.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 7.9</em></div>

14. Change the desired settings of the **LAYOUT** panel.

15. Click **Save** to save the layout settings as shown in Figure 7.10.

## Insert Subcircuit 
Subcircuits can be nested across other circuit tabs as a CV simulation or as a Verilog module. This section lists the different steps for inserting subcircuits generated as a CV simulation or as a Verilog code.
### a. Insert Subcircuit as a CircuitVerse Simulation
Follow the below steps for building a full adder circuit using two half-adder subcircuits:

16. Click on the add tab icon (refer Figure 7.11) displayed in the circuit tab section. Alternatively, you may also click on **NewCircuit+** selection in the **Circuit** drop-down menu. As shown in Figure 7.11, the **Enter circuit name:** pop up window is displayed.
