# Testing CircuitVerse circuits

The Testbench helps you test your circuits in the simulator itself

### It's here in this corner

### Attach a test to a circuit

Each circuit in a project can be attached a test, this test is saved along with your circuits. So the next time you load your circuit, the test loads with it.

### Create the test using the test creator

The test creator provides an intuitive UI to create tests.

- Select the type of test - `Sequential` or `Combinational`
- Add inputs / outputs by clicking the `+` icon next to `INPUTS` / `OUTPUTS` label.
- Add another test to the group by clicking `+` icon below
- Add another group by clicking `New Group`

For sequential tests, clock is ticked between each Group. For combinational tests, Groups are just a logical seperation between different types of tests.

Alternatively, you can also export the created test as CSV and edit it. You can import this CSV to attch by clicking `Import from CSV`

Finally,

- Save and attach the test by clicking `Attach`

### Label your circuit elements

The testbench uses the element labels to identify Input and Output elements. So make sure they are labelled the same as that in the tests.

Click `Validate` to make sure you have added all elements properly
