# About

__CircuitVerse Docs__ is the official documentation of the [CircuitVerse simulator](https://circuitverse.org/simulator/). This is meant to be a guide for enthusiasts to use and explore the full capabilities of the CircuitVerse simulator. The documentation is to have details of the usage of all Circuit Elements in CircuitVerse along with some tips and tricks. This guide assumes minimum knowledge of the user.


__CircuitVerse__ is a product developed by students at IIIT-Bangalore. It aims to provide a platform where circuits can be designed and simulated using a graphical user interface. While users can design complete CPU implementations within the simulator, the software is designed primarily for educational use. CircuitVerse is an opensource project with an active community.
