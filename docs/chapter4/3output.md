3. [VariableLED](#variableled)
4. [RGBLED](#rgbled)
5. [SquareRGBLED](#squarergbled)
6. [HexDisplay](#hexdisplay)
7. [SevenSegDisplay](#sevensegdisplay)
8. [SixteenSegDisplay](#sixteensegdisplay)

## Output

When the **Output** circuit element is connected to another circuit element, it displays the relevant output in binary form. 

>Properties that can be customized in the **PROPERTIES** panel include: **BitWidth**

You can verify the behavior of the **Output** circuit element in the live circuit embedded below:

## Digital LED

The **Digital LED** element switches between on and off depending on the input applied to it. 

*   Input of `1` turns on the LED 
*   Input of `0` turns off the LED. 

The digital LED does not recognize inputs of a length other than one bit. For your project, if the color must be changed based on the applied input, use the [RGB LED element](https://docs.circuitverse.org/#/outputs?id=rgb-led).

## VariableLED

The **variableLED** element changes between 256 intensities based on an 8-bit input. It has a:

*   Maximum intensity when the input applied is `11111111` 
*   Zero intensity when the input applied is `00000000`.

## RGBLED

Unlike the **digitalLED or variableLED** circuit elements, the **RGBLED** element can display a wide variety of colors. It takes three 8-bit inputs which describe the intensity of red, green, and blue color respectively.

>TIP: Use a [color picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to find the corresponding R, G, and B values and then use a [decimal-to-binary converter](https://codebeautify.org/decimal-binary-converter) to find the corresponding 8-bit value that must be entered for each input.

## SquareRGBLED

While the **SquareRGBLED** works similarly to the **RGBLED**, the **SquareRGBLED** differs in its shape and includes pin lengths that can be customized in the **PROPERTIES** panel. These additional features make **SquareRGBLEDs** ideal for simulating arrays of pixels.

> Properties that can be customized in the **PROPERTIES** panel include: **Pin Length**

The live circuit embedded below illustrates how an array of pixels may be programmed to display an image. The circuit design includes a LED buffer subcircuit that manages the circuitry controlling the LEDs. The ability to vary the pin length of the square RGB LED element makes the design clean and easy to read.  To make the design more comprehensible, the pins for different square LEDs must remain in the same vertical order as the LEDs themselves (i.e. the top pins must correspond to the top LED).

## HexDisplay

The **HexDisplay** is more simple to use than the** SevenSegDisplay** and **SixteenSegDisplay **circuit elements. Since it takes a 4-bit input and can display integers 1 through 9 and the letters A through F, there is less room for customization. 

The input bits do not control the individual segments ( as it is not possible to control six segments with only four bits). The hex display simply recognizes the integer/letter that a given input corresponds to and displays the character. The display character thus does not need to be programmed.

## SevenSegDisplay

The **SevenSegDisplay** behaves similar to a **HexDisplay**, but it takes an 8-bit input rather than a 4-bit input––making it more customizable. It takes in eight inputs and displays an output, an integer from 1 to 9. As Figure 4.2 elucidates, the top four inputs correspond to the middle, top left, top, and top right segments from left to right respectively. The bottom four inputs correspond to the bottom left, bottom, bottom right, and decimal segments from left to right respectively.

## SixteenSegDisplay

The **SixteenSegDisplay** takes two inputs and a total of 17 bits: 16 bits in the top input and 1 bit in the bottom input. Each of the 16 bits applied to the top input corresponds to a certain segment in the sixteen segment display. The single bit applied to the bottom input controls the decimal point. 

You can verify the behavior of the **SixteenSegDisplay** circuit element in the live circuit embedded below:

As opposed to the **HexDisplay** and **SevenSegDisplay** circuit elements, the main advantage of using a **SixteenSegDisplay** is that multiple segments  can be used to create numbers and letters. However, it requires double the input of the **SevenSegDisplay** and quadruple the input of the **HexDisplay**.
