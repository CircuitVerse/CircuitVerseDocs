# Getting Started with CircuitVerse User Account
While a user can browse through the CircuitVerse contributions and build circuit simulations without creating a CircuitVerse user account, having a CircuitVerse user account empowers a user to do different tasks including:

1. Use dashboard to save and manage circuit simulation files 
2. Fork a live circuit contribution to explore and build upon the work of other users
3. Share circuit simulation project files using unique URLs
4. Collaborate with different user groups for different group projects
5. Embed interactive circuits using iframe within web pages and Google Slides

## Create CircuitVerse User Account
CircuitVerse platform supports Google, Facebook and GitHub sign in secure authentication systems to reduce the burden of login for the users. Users can get started by signing in with their Google, Facebook or GitHub Account, or creating a user account using their preferred email address.
