# CircuitVerse for Educators
While understanding and learning the concepts of digital circuit design, students must learn through simulation of daily engineering tasks, including design verification and testing. This section highlights how educators can use the CircuitVerse tool as an educational tool for managing student groups, assignments and grades in one place (refer Figure 2.2). Some of the key workflows available within the CV tool include:
*   Create different student groups for different coursework
*   Add mentors to different student groups
*   Add members to different student groups
*   Add assignments for student groups while managing the deadlines and the grading scale
*   Grade assignments for different student groups
*   Embed interactive circuits using iframe within different web pages.

## Add Assignments

Assignments can be successfully added for different groups while managing the deadlines and the grading scale. While describing the assignment in the description box, any elements relevant to the assignment may be disabled using a toggle button. The grading scale must be identified during the initial setup although the grades can only be added when the deadline has passed.  If needed, after the deadline has passed, an assignment can be reopened. 

> NOTE: An assignment can only be viewed by group members if they are part of the group.

Follow the below steps to add assignments for a selected group:

## Embed CircuitVerse Simulation in Webpages

Since CircuitVerse is built using the HTML5 markup language, an iframe can be generated for each CircuitVerse simulation for embedding it within web pages and Google Slides. 
> NOTE: The **Project access type:** property for the project that must be embedded must be set to **Public.** Refer Figure 2.44.

![](../images/img_chapter2/2.44.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 2.44</em></div>

Follow the below steps to embed a CircuitVerse simulation within a web page:

1. Navigate to your account displayed in the upper right hand corner of your screen. Select **Dashboard** from the drop-down menu to display your dashboard. Refer Figure 2.45.

    ![](../images/img_chapter2/2.45.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 2.45</em></div>

2. Navigate to the project that you wish to embed. Refer Figure 2.46.

    ![](../images/img_chapter2/2.46.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 2.46</em></div>

3. Click on the **More** button to display the project details page. Refer Figure 2.47.

    ![](../images/img_chapter2/2.47.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 2.47</em></div>

    ![](../images/img_chapter2/2.48.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 2.48</em></div>

5. Copy the displayed iframe value and paste the iframe code within the HTML frame of the desired webpage. The circuit will be embedded with the **Made with CircuitVerse** watermark as shown in Figure 2.49.  

    ![](../images/img_chapter2/2.49.png)

    <div align="center"><em>Figure 2.49</em></div>

## Embed CircuitVerse Simulation in Google Slides

Since Google Slides does not support live circuit simulations, CircuitVerse live circuits can be embedded in Google Slides after installing the relevant browser extension. 

*   CircuitVerse Chrome Extension: [Download link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circuitverse/nmmehnggkgmdfbpfnebaimfjdbgmoaoo)
*   CircuitVerse Firefox Extension: Download link

When the extension is successfully installed, it is displayed as an option in the Menu bar. Refer Figure 2.50.

> NOTE: If the menu option is not available, then the Google Slides addon may not get installed successfully.

![](../images/img_chapter2/2.50.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 2.50: CircuitVerse Chrome Extension for embedding Live Circuit in Google Slides</em></div>

Watch the below video for a quick demonstration of how the CircuitVerse Chrome extension works in Google Slides.

## Download Image

CircuitVerse offers different options for downloading images in different formats and resolutions for reuse across different documentation projects (refer Figure 2.51). Table 2.5 shares a brief description of the different image formats supported within CircuitVerse. 

> NOTE: Images for circuit simulation projects that are part of a CircuitVerse user account can only be downloaded. As needed, a user can fork an existing circuit contribution to add the CircuitVerse project to their dashboard.

![](../images/img_chapter2/2.55.png)
