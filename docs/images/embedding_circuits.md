You can also embed the circuits present in the  CircuitVerse to your web page or any other platform which supports embedding iframe. Here we will see how to the embed code in a web page.

#### Getting the Embed code

a) To embed your circuit first go to "My Circuits" 

![](/home/igaurab/Documents/CircuitVerseDocs/docs/images/embedding/mycircuit.jpg)

b) Select the circuit you want to embed and click on "More"

c) Click on "Embed."

d) You will now get the embed code for your circuit. The code is copied to your clipboard by default.

> The same process is true for any other circuits. 

#### Using the Embed code.

In order to embed the circuit into your websites you can simply paste the embed code on the part of the web page you want it to be displayed.

You now should be able to see the circuit with "Made with CircuitVerse" watermark on your website.

> Note: You can also embed the circuits into your power-point slide through a third party tool called [liveslide](<https://www.liveslides.com/>)
