# Combinational Analysis

> Automatically generate circuit based on truth table data. This is great to create complex logic circuits and can easily be made into a subcircuit.

## Combinational Analysis Menu

On the circuit verse simulator page. Hover on Tools (Tools &rightarrow; combinational analysis). Click on combinational analysis, then go head and supply the input and ouput names, for the circuit you want to generate. click on next, then change the ouput values to the output values of the circuit you want to generate, by clicking on (x). After this, go ahead and click generate circuit. This is how you use combinational analysis to create logic circuits.

## Converting to subcircuit

Right click on your workspace and click on new circuit. Lets call this new circuit, circuit 2. Then to insert the circuit you generated from the combinational analysis as a subcircuit in circuit 2, enter the workspace for circuit 2, then go to Circuit &rightarrow; insert Subcircuit. That is how you insert a subcircuit.
