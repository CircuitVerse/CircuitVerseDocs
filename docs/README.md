# Welcome to CircuitVerse
> Have you ever wondered how does all the complexity of the computer design boil down to connecting wires and gates? Do you want to have an intuvitive experience while building and learning stuff? Behold! Rest assured you have come to the right place. 

> Here at circuit verse, we believe that seeing theory play into real stuff is the crux of learning. Normally, even the best books on digital circuitry lack stimulation features that CircuitVerse provides to you. The best part is it is free and you can contribute to it too.

> CircuitVerse is extremely easy for beginners and experienced alike. This documentation will help you get started quickly.
