Select the circuit element type and drop on canvas or drag the object onto canvas.

## Connecting wires

#### There are two ways to connect wires between elements of the circuit:

1. Click one node and simply drag the mouse to the other node.

2. Hold down `Ctrl`, click on a node and simply move the cursor to the final node to which it needs to be attached. Clicking on the wire will insert a node at that position.

Upon reaching the final node, let go of `Ctrl` and simply click on the node to end the wire.
