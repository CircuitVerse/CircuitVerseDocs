# Circuit Elements Panel
CircuitVerse offers a vast library of circuit elements (refer Figure 3.12) for building different types of digital circuits. Each circuit element has its own properties, and the relevant properties can be edited using the PROPERTIES panel. Chapter 4 shares a  detailed description of the different customizable attributes of these circuit elements.
