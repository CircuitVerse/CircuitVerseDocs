# Canvas
Canvas is the large empty space available in the middle of the simulator for building the desired circuit. Circuit elements can be dragged from the **CIRCUIT ELEMENTS** panel into the Canvas and arranged to build the circuit. Each circuit element has its own properties, and the relevant properties can be edited using the **PROPERTIES** panel. As the design matures, the user can conveniently move, rearrange or rotate components on the drawing canvas, create subcircuits for managing sophisticated designs or add annotation elements for improved understanding.
