# Quick Access Panel

The quick access panel (refer Figure 3.20) provides access to common workflows within the CircuitVerse simulator.  While working on the circuit, hover the mouse over the icons for a brief description. As needed, the tool bar can be conveniently moved around the canvas or positioned in the menu bar.
