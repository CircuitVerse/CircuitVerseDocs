## Project

CircuitVerse provides different options for creating and managing CircuitVerse projects online or offline. Table 3.3 shares a brief description of the different options available in the **Project** drop-down menu (refer Figure 3.3).

While saving projects online, users are directed to the **Edit Project** page for sharing more details about the project (refer Figure 3.4).

## Circuit

As the circuit design grows, the **Circuit** drop-down menu (refer Figure 3.5) lists different options for managing the design structure. Table 3.4 further shares a brief description of the different options. 

![drawing](/images/img_chapter3/3.5.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 3.5</em></div>

Table 3.4: Brief description of different selections available in the Circuit drop-down menu
<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Name</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>New Circuit+
   </td>
   <td>Adds a new tab in the circuit tab bar
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>New Verilog Module
   </td>
   <td>Inserts a circuit comprising of Verilog module
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Insert Subcircuit
   </td>
   <td>Inserts a circuit layout generated using CircuitVerse simulator as a subcircuit in another circuit tab
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Besides adding multiple circuit tabs within a project, circuit tabs can also be nested within other circuit tabs for organizing a hierarchical design. A subcircuit is a modular functional block that delivers a single function within a given design. Additionally, a subcircuit generated using a Verilog module can also be inserted.
> NOTE: Unlike CircuitVerse simulations, the circuit generated using a Verilog module can be simulated as a subcircuit only. 


## Tools

Table 3.5 shares a brief description of the different options available in the **Tools** drop-down menu (refer Figure 3.6).

## Combinational Analysis Tool

The Combinational Analysis tool available within the CircuitVerse simulator generates a circuit using combinational analysis or a boolean function (refer Figure 3.7). A truth table is then populated to construct the final circuit using different different gates and circuit elements.

> NOTE:  If the user generates the circuit by entering a boolean function, then the truth table is auto populated else the user must manually set the values.

<div align="center"><em>Figure 3.7: Besides building a circuit using different circuit elements, the combinational analysis tool can also be used for generating a circuit using combinational analysis or a boolean function</em></div>

The circuit's inputs and outputs will be displayed in top-down and left-right  order corresponding to how they were identified in the **Boolean Logic Table** popup window. Watch the below video to learn more about this tool.

## Hex-Bin-Dec Converter

The Hex-Bin-Dec Converter tool (refer Figure 3.8) converts a given binary number into its equivalent decimal, octal or hexadecimal value. Alternatively, a user can also generate a binary value from different available  formats.

![drawing](/images/img_chapter3/3.8.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 3.8: Use the dec-bin-hex convertool to convert binary data into different formats</em></div>

## Themes

Different themes have been included that change the colors of the CircuitVerse simulator user interface (UI) while maintaining the contrast across different UI elements.  Refer Figure 3.9.

![drawing](/images/img_chapter3/3.9.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 3.9: Different CircuitVerse simulator UI themes</em></div>

## Custom Shortcuts

The Custom Shortcuts window displays different shortcuts for common user operations. As required, each of the available key shortcuts can be edited for a user preference and restored back to its default value. Refer Figure 3.10.

<div align="center"><em>Figure 3.10: Different key shortcuts available within CiruitVerse</em></div>

## Export Verilog 

Every circuit simulation project created within CircuitVerse can be exported as a Verilog code. As Figure 3.11 illustrates, the code file can then either be downloaded on the machine as a verilog file or tested on https://www.edaplayground.com/ using Icarus Verilog 0.9.7. 

> NOTE: This is an experimental module and some changes may be needed for the code to work.
