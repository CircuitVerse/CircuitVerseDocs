# Clock Time versus Delay

Before exploring how to visualize a timing diagram for a given circuit, this section explores some key concepts that define the working of the **TIMING DIAGRAM** panel.

## Clock Time (ms): 

The **Clock Time** property attribute in Figure 6.1 refers to the time interval for the half cycle of a circuit. Changing the clock time interval speeds up or slows down the circuit simulation. However, it should be noted that changing the **Delay** attribute for any circuit element doesn't change circuit behavior. This clock frequency is only for demonstration purposes.

## Delay 

The **Delay** property parameter for a circuit element delays refers to propagation delays.  It should be noted that the delays are simulated––they are virtual and therefore not rendered. 

The **Delay** parameter doesn't have a unit as delays are processed relative to each other. Unlike the **Clock Time (ms)** attribute, the **Delay** parameter changes the behaviour of the circuit and should be used to resolve race conditions. They can be visualized using a timing diagram as described in the next section. 

## Clock Time and Delay: CircuitVerse Implemented Restrictions

The below design restrictions have been implemented in the CV simulator to ease the design and verification of circuits, without imposing untoward restrictions:

1. Real life circuits go into a stable state between clock ticks. Irrespective of any implemented circuit element delays, the circuits go into a stable state between clock ticks. The CV simulator thus cannot simulate circuits that do not go into a stable state between clock ticks. 
2. Similarly, circuits go into a stable state before processing input signals from different input elements like buttons and stepper.
3. Contamination delay = Propagation delay
4. Hold time = 0
