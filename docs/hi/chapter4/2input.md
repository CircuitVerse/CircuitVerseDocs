# Input

Circuitverse features different input elements listed below:

1. [Input](#input)
2. [Button](#button)
3. [Power](#power)
4. [Ground](#ground)
5. [ConstantVal](#constantval)
6. [Stepper](#stepper)
7. [Counter](#counter)

## Input

The **Input** circuit element can have two input states - HIGH or LOW. 

Property attributes that can be customized within the **PROPERTIES** panel include**:** **BitWidth**

You can verify the behavior of the **Input** circuit element (by clicking on the circuit element once) in the live circuit embedded below:

## Button

The **Button** circuit element  is a simple push button mechanism for controlling the output of the circuit. 

*   HIGH when pressed
*   LOW when released

You can verify the behavior of the **Button** circuit element in the live circuit embedded below:

## Power

The **Power** circuit element in the circuit design is always in a HIGH state. This component should be used when there is a need for  the input to be always HIGH.
<br>In the live circuit embedded below, multiple LEDs are arranged in the form of "HI". As the LEDs are all connected to the **Power** circuit element, they will always glow.

## Ground

The **Ground** circuit element in the circuit design is always in a LOW state.

While in AC power distribution and some radio antenna systems the “ground” implies a connection to the earth,  in digital logic design "ground" is a point in the circuit that the user calls as zero volts. The ground in the circuit is used as a reference for measuring voltages across different points in the circuit.

## ConstantVal

The **ConstantVal** circuit element allows the user to input a constant value (instead of 0 and 1).

As the above example explains, the value of the **ConstantVal** circuit element can be changed by double-clicking the component and entering the value in the prompt.


## Stepper

The value of the **Stepper** circuit element can either be increased or decreased by pressing the "+" key or "-" key on the keyboard to increase or decrease the value. 

You can verify the behavior of the **Stepper** circuit element in the live circuit embedded below:

## Random

The **Random** circuit element generates a random value in the range (0, maxvalue) every time it receives a HIGH signal from the clock. As the simulation demonstrates, it has 3 ports in total:

*   Max Value: input, maximum value generated.
*   Clock: input clock element. Every time the clock receives a HIGH input, the random element generates a number.
*   Random Value: output, the number generated

The value is also displayed in decimal notation on the random element.

## Counter

The **Counter** circuit element is a binary counter that runs from zero to a specified maximum value. As the simulation demonstrates, it has five ports in total:

*   Max Value: input, maximum value that the counter will reach.
*   Clock: input clock element, every time the clock gets HIGH the counter increments by one.
*   Reset: input, when HIGH it resets the counter to zero.
*   Zero: output, it's HIGH when the counter is zero.
*   Value: output, value of the counter in binary.

The value is also displayed in decimal notation on the counter element.
