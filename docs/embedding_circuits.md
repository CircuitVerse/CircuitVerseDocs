# Embedding Circuits

> This section is a helpful step-by-step guide for new contributors trying to improve the CircuitVerse Documentation by embedding circuits.

These circuits can be embedded anywhere (apart from the documentation) since they utilize `iframe` HTML tag generated from the Circuitverse [website](https://circuitverse.org/)).

#### Getting the Embed code

a) To embed your circuit first go to "My Circuits" 

<center>

![](images/embedding_circuits/mycircuits.png)
</center>

b) Select the circuit you want to embed and click on "More"

<center>

![](images/embedding_circuits/more.png)
</center>

c) Click on "Embed."

<center>

</center>

d) You will now get the embed code for your circuit. The code is copied to your clipboard by default.

</center>

> The same process is true for any other circuits. 

#### Using the Embed code

In order to embed the circuit into documentation/any other webpage simply paste the embed code on the part of the web page you want it to be displayed. 

You now should be able to see the circuit with "Made with CircuitVerse" watermark:

<center>
<iframe width="600px" height="400px" src="https://circuitverse.org/simulator/embed/109920" id="projectPreview" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</center>

> Note: You can also embed the circuits into a powerpoint presentation through a third party tool called [liveslide](<https://www.liveslides.com/>)
