# ISSUE & PULL REQUEST LABELING GUIDELINES

**Repository:** CircuitVerseDocs  
**Website:** https://docs.circuitverse.org/

---

## OVERVIEW

This document defines the labeling system used for issues and pull requests in the **CircuitVerseDocs** repository.  
The purpose of these labels is to organize documentation-related work, improve issue visibility, and make collaboration easier for contributors and maintainers.

This repository primarily deals with **documentation content** and **documentation site UI/UX**, so labels focus on content accuracy, completeness, and usability.

Labels should be applied only after:

- Verifying the issue is relevant to documentation
- Checking for existing or related issues
- Ensuring the issue addresses a single concern

Issues covering multiple concerns should be split for clarity.
