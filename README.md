# CircuitVerse Documentation

This is the official documentation of the CircuitVerse simulator. This is meant to be a guide for users to use CircuitVerse. This is to have details of the usage of all Circuit Elements in CircuitVerse along with some tips and tricks. This guide has to assume minimum knowledge of the user. 

To view the docs in offline mode, run
`python3 -m http.server` or 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` 

Note that all documentation should have a corresponding live circuit embedded so as to help the users.
