# CircuitVerse for Educators

While understanding and learning the concepts of digital circuit design, students must learn through simulation of daily engineering tasks, including design verification and testing. This section highlights how educators can use the CircuitVerse tool as an educational tool for managing student groups, assignments, and grades in one place (refer to Figure 2.2). Some of the key workflows available within the CV tool include:

- Create different student groups for different coursework
- Add mentors to different student groups
- Add members to different student groups
- Add assignments for student groups while managing the deadlines and the grading scale
- Grade assignments for different student groups
- Embed interactive circuits using iframe within different web pages.

## Embed CircuitVerse Simulation in Google Slides

Since Google Slides does not support live circuit simulations, CircuitVerse live circuits can be embedded in Google Slides after installing the relevant browser extension.

- CircuitVerse Chrome Extension: [Download link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circuitverse/nmmehnggkgmdfbpfnebaimfjdbgmoaoo)
- CircuitVerse Firefox Extension: Download link

When the extension is successfully installed, it is displayed as an option in the menu bar. Refer to Figure 2.50.

> **NOTE:** If the menu option is not available, then the Google Slides addon may not have been installed successfully.

![](/img/img_chapter2/2.50.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 2.50: CircuitVerse Chrome Extension for embedding Live Circuit in Google Slides</em></div>

Watch the below video for a quick demonstration of how the CircuitVerse Chrome extension works in Google Slides.

## Download Image

CircuitVerse offers different options for downloading images in different formats and resolutions for reuse across different documentation projects (refer to Figure 2.51). Table 2.5 shares a brief description of the different image formats supported within CircuitVerse.

> **NOTE:** Images for circuit simulation projects that are part of a CircuitVerse user account can only be downloaded. As needed, a user can fork an existing circuit contribution to add the CircuitVerse project to their dashboard.

![](/img/img_chapter2/2.55.png)

<div align="center"><em>Figure 2.51: Different image formats, views, and resolutions supported within CircuitVerse</em></div>

**Table 2.5: Different image formats supported within CircuitVerse**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Name</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PNG</td>
    <td>Renders image in PNG format. This is the default setting for rendering images in CircuitVerse.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JPEG</td>
    <td>Renders images in JPEG format. This setting is widely supported across different browsers and applications. JPEG images are typically small in file size, making them ideal for email attachments and presentations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SVG</td>
    <td>Renders images in SVG format. This setting is recommended for web pages and animations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BMP</td>
    <td>Renders image in BMP format. This setting is recommended for high-quality scans and archival copies. BMP files are typically high in quality and have a large size.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GIF</td>
    <td>Renders image in GIF format. This setting is recommended for web images and animations. GIF files are typically small in size.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TIFF</td>
    <td>Renders image in TIFF format. This setting is recommended for high-quality prints, professional publications, and archival copies.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Besides rendering images in multiple formats and resolutions, CircuitVerse images can be downloaded in multiple views (with or without transparent background) to suit one's image needs (refer to Figure 2.51). Table 2.6 shares a brief description of the different image views supported within CircuitVerse.

**Table 2.6: Different image views supported within CircuitVerse**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Name</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full Circuit View</td>
    <td>Displays the full circuit view of the displayed image. The simulator zooms in or out of the current view so that the circuit image fits the entire screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Current View</td>
    <td>Displays the image captured in the current simulator view. This is the default selected view for rendering images.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transparent Background</td>
    <td>
      Reproduces the image with a transparent background. By default, this setting is not selected.
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This setting only works for the PNG format because only PNG supports a transparent background. A transparent background image rendered in CircuitVerse does not have a white background.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resolution</td>
    <td>Renders the image for different resolution settings. While 1x is the default setting, for higher-resolution images, the other options (2x and 4x) can be selected.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
