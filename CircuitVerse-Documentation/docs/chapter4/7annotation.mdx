# Annotation

This section highlights the different annotation elements available in the **CIRCUIT ELEMENTS** panel for circuit description. A circuit schematic can be annotated by:

- Adding labels across different nodes.
- Including text boxes for displaying relevant project information such as the version number, date, group members involved, etc..
- Adding rectangular boxes for highlighting different sections for complex designs.
- Inserting images for sharing more information about the project.

Additionally, most of the circuit elements listed in the **CIRCUIT ELEMENTS** panel can be individually described on the **Canvas** using the **Label** and **Label Direction** attributes available in the **PROPERTIES** panel (refer Figure 4.13).

</div>

## Rectangle

The **Rectangle** annotation element allows the user to draw attention to a specific portion of the circuit. Refer Figure 4.14 for how a user has the **Rectangle** circuit element for highlighting the key portion of the circuit.

**Properties that can be customized in the PROPERTIES panel include:** **Rows, Columns**

## Arrow

Similar to the **Rectangle** annotation element, the **Arrow** annotation element (refer Figure 4.14) allows the user to draw attention to a specific portion of the circuit. The direction of the **Arrow** circuit element can be changed either by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or using the **PROPERTIES** panel to edit the **Direction**: attribute (refer Figure 4.15).

> Properties that can be customized in the **PROPERTIES** panel include: **Direction**

## ImageAnnotation

The **ImageAnnotation** annotation element allows the user to upload images inside the live circuit. As needed, the height and width of the uploaded image can be changed by editing the **Rows** and **Columns** attributes available for the **ImageAnnotation** annotation element in the **PROPERTIES** panel (refer Figure 4.16).

## Text

The **Text** annotation element allows users to add multi-line text to share more information about the live circuit––circuit logic design details of the circuit, expected behavior of the circuit, etc.. Refer Figure 4.14.
