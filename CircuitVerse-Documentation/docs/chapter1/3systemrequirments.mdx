# System Requirements

In order to access CircuitVerse simulations on a Mac or a PC, you will need a broadband internet connection and a compatible web browser. CircuitVerse officially supports Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. While users have been able to successfully run the simulator on Apple Safari, we are unable to officially support this browser at this time.

> NOTE: Since CircuitVerse is built in HTML5, browsers do not require Flash Player or JavaScript to load the CircuitVerse simulator.

Additionally, CircuitVerse does not support touch screen devices or mobile browsers for any device.
