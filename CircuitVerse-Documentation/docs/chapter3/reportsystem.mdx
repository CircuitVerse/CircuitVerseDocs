A user can report an unexpected behavior frequently using **Report an issue** button displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen (refer Figure 3.21). For effective bug reporting, the description field must include detailed information for reproducing the issue. Some of the good-to-have information include:

- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected result of the application
- Actual result of the application
- Supporting artifacts like screenshots or videos

Alternatively, any ideas, feature requests or bug fixes can be submitted on GitHub at https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/issues/new/choose.

> TIP: Before reporting an issue, submit a query on the CircuitVerse Forum (https://circuitverse.org/forum) to learn more about similar experiences or known workarounds.
