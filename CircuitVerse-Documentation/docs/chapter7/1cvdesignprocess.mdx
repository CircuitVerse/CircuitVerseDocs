# Understanding CircuitVerse Design Process

CircuitVerse simulator allows users to build and simulate their designs on the go. Users can build a circuit by dragging elements from the **CIRCUIT ELEMENTS** panel and setting the relevant properties for each element using the **PROPERTIES** panel. Different circuit elements can then be connected by clicking on the output of one gate or port, and dragging the mouse to the input of the next one. While nesting circuits within one another, the circuit layout must be edited before inserting the subcircuit. If required, the **Combinational Analysis** tool can also be used to simulate the behavior of a functional design using truth tables and Boolean expressions.

Finally, the circuit schematic must be annotated using the different annotation elements available in the **PROPERTIES** panel. Any questions or suggestions can be shared with the CircuitVerse Forum where CircuitVerse mentors and a growing community of users can answer your queries or share quick workarounds.

For best practices of building circuits within CircuitVerse, [refer this section](/chapter2/4bestpracticescv.mdx).
